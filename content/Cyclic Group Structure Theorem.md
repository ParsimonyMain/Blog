In a cyclic group of order $q$, if $n \mid q$, there exists a subgroup of size $n$.
### Proof
1. **Cyclic Groups**: A cyclic group $G$ of order $q$ is a group that can be generated by a single element, say $g$. In other words, every element of $G$ can be expressed as $g^k$ for some integer $k.$ The order of $G$ is the number of distinct elements in $G$, which is $q$ in this case.
2. **Subgroup Orders in Cyclic Groups**: In a cyclic group of order $q$, every divisor of $q$ corresponds to a unique subgroup. Specifically, if $n$ divides $q$, then there is exactly one subgroup of $G$ with order $n$.
3. **Generating Subgroups**: To see why this works, note that if $n$ divides $q$, then there exists an element of order $n$ in $G$. For a cyclic group $G$ of order $q$, the element $g$ (the generator of $G$) can be used to generate subgroups of different orders. The cyclic subgroup generated by $g^{q/n}$ will have order $n$, because:
    - The element $g^{q/n}$ has order $n$ because $(g^{q/n})^n=g^q=e$ (where $e$ is the identity element), and $n$ is the smallest integer for which this is true.
    - The subgroup generated by $g^{q/n}$ contains $n$ distinct elements: $\{e, g^{q/n}, g^{2(q/n)}, ..., g^{(n-1)(q/n)}\}$.

Thus, if $n$ divides $q$, then the cyclic group of order $q$ contains a unique subgroup of order $n$.
